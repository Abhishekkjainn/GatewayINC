          Visa Requirements for International Students
        </div>
        <div className="page2canadacontent ">
          International students planning to study in Canada require a study
          permit, a crucial immigration document that validates their stay in
          the country alongside a visitor visa or Electronic Travel
          Authorization (eTA). This permit is essential for Indian students as
          it grants permission to study at Designated Learning Institutions
          (DLIs) in Canada. <br />
          <br />
          It's important to note that a study permit is distinct from a visa. A
          student visa is required for entry into Canada. To apply for a
          Canadian Student Visa, it is recommended to initiate the process 4 to
          6 months before the start of classes, upon receiving an Admission
          Offer from a Canadian DLI. Applications can be made online through the
          Government of Canada Key (GCKey) portal, at a Visa Application Centre
          (VAC), or directly at the port of entry. The application fee for a
          Canadian Student Visa is $150 CAD, which includes a $85 CAD biometrics
          fee and a $45 CAD service fee. <br />
          <br />
          Processing time for a study visa typically ranges from 4 to 8 weeks.
          For expedited processing, the Student Direct Stream (SDS) option
          completes the process in just 20 days. Indian students eligible for
          SDS can apply by submitting the required documents for their student
          visa application.
